# Tips (Using JQ)
To make it easy for testing, it is recommended to download the `known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json` and rename it as `today.json`. 

### Show the information about JSON file.
```console
$ cat today.json | jq  ' .title , .catalogVersion , .dateReleased , .count  '                                                                                                                                                                         3 тип
"CISA Catalog of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"
"2022.03.31.2"
"2022-03-31T16:29:24.2424Z"
609
```

### List all the vulnerabilities that will due on 2022-04-15, and show in one line per object.
```console
$ cat today.json | jq -c '.vulnerabilities[] | select ( .dueDate == "2022-04-15" ) '
